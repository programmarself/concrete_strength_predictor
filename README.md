# 🏗️ Concrete Strength Predictor App

This is a simple web application that predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on its mix components. It is built using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit.

## 📊 Project Purpose
The app allows users to input concrete mix details such as:
- Cement
- Blast Furnace Slag
- Fly Ash
- Water
- Superplasticizer
- Coarse Aggregate
- Fine Aggregate
- Age of Concrete (days)

It predicts the **compressive strength of the concrete (MPa)** using a machine learning regression model.

## 🎯 Project Highlights
- Machine Learning-based prediction
- Civil Engineering relevance
- User-friendly web interface via Streamlit
- Public dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
